# File Information

Project for Operating System Lab

The primary objective of this project is to introduce fundamental programming concepts, focusing on working with files and interprocess communication using pipes.

In brief, the program takes three arguments:

1. The first argument represents the directory where all the files to be analyzed are stored. The program examines BMP files, link files, directories, and regular files within this specified directory.

2. The second argument denotes the output directory, where statistics about the analyzed files are stored. Additionally, for each BMP file in the input directory, a corresponding grayscale duplicate is created in the output directory.

3. The third argument is dedicated to the script called within main.c (checkLine.sh). This argument is a character.
